◊emph{The ◊seclink{color} library now provides everything
this library used to provide. We recommend that you use that instead.}

}

It used to contain the definitions for ◊pyret-id["Color" "color"],
which you can now find by importing the ◊seclink{color} module
instead.

To maintain backward compatibility, this library still provides those
definitions, but your program should update to using the
◊seclink{color} library.
