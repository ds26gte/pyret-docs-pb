Goal: Converting pyret-docs from Scribble to Pollen. 

Also: Controlling https://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap Web Framework] elements from Pollen.


== Pyret doc

The WIP Pollen version of the pyret documentation source is in this
repo.

(To browse directly in GitHub:
https://github.com/ds26gte/pyret-docs-pb).

The rendered version of the Pollenized Pyret doc is at
https://ds26gte.github.io/attic/pyret-docs.

== How

Type `make` to create the HTML locally.

== What

https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen[Pollen] allows the use of Racket to create complicated Web pages in
particular, and also other outputs. Since Bootstrap seems to be
HTML only, we'll restrict ourselves to HTML. However, our source
is in `poly` format, so we could go to other output
formats if needed.

TIP: If we know we're only targeting HTML, we could call our input
file `lorem.html.pm` instead of `lorem.poly.pm`.


Pollen allows multiple input document formats, e.g., HTML,
Markdown, Pollen Markup. For the most extensibility, we probably
want Pollen Markup. The input file has extension `.html.pm`. This
suggests that the input format should be HTML, but we'll add a
Pollen Racket file link:./pollen.rkt[] to allow for a more forgiving
input style, e.g., with blank lines signifying paragraph separation,
automatic conversion to smart quotes and dashes, automatic
creation of external title. (Very likely others as we learn more.)

Also, I'm restricting myself to one input file, but we can add a
_page tree_ of files with interconnecting nav bars later.

Pollen markup provides all the well-known HTML tags, but with a
different but easily deducible syntax.  See the various *.poly.pm
files
for some examples.

We can use Pollen markup syntax to include classes and other
attributes. These can be the Bootstrap-provided classes, as long
as the template file link:./template.html.p[] adds in the Bootstrap-related CSS and JS.

link:./pollen.rkt[] can be used to modify existing tags and create new tags
-- examples of both are provided. Crucial Pollen Racket functions
are: `define-tag-function`, `default-tag-function`,
`decode-elements`, and `txexpr`. Ideally we should be able to put
most of the work on `define-` and `default-tag-function`: the
former acts like a macro for creating new tags, and the latter
extracts the original values of tags.

== Time

This is WIP.
